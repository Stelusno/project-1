## Technologies Used:
### HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## What Did I Build And How It Works? 
### I built a complete web-browser based card matching game. Click on the card and it will show a color. If you match the colors together it will stay faced up. If not it will face back down and you will need to try again. There is a built in delay when you click so no need to double click. Click the "Play Again" button to reset the game at any time. Have fun!!

## Next Steps:
### Next steps would be to add a Winner message and a shuffle function.
